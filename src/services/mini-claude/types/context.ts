/**
 * Context management types

 * NOTE: This file is deprecated and will be removed.
 * New implementation uses inline types in:
 * - SimpleContextMonitor.ts (ContextStats)
 * - ConversationCompressor.ts (CompressionResult, CompressionOptions)
 *
 * This file is kept temporarily to avoid breaking any legacy imports.

// Types are now defined inline in the new implementation files
